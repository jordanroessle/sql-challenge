# sql-challenge
After analysize the six CSV files included, I put together an ERD, which can be viewed in the ERD.png file. 
Next there is a schema.sql file that properly sets up the tables for the database to read the given CSV files. This ensures all the foregien keys and primary keys are set up properly to match the ERD.  
Finally, within the queries.sql file I have given queries to gather the data requested in the instructions pasted below:


1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
